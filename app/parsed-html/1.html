<h2>How to export passwords from Chrome</h2>

<p><em>Published on 2024-02-02.</em></p>

<p>If you want to leave Google, one of the first things you must do is stop using its proprietary browser, Chrome, and its built-in
<a href="https://localhost:8081/blog/what-is-a-password-manager">password manager</a>. A vital first step towards leaving Google is downloading
your passwords so you can transition more easily to a new, better password manager. This article explains how you can quickly export your passwords
from Chrome.</p>

<h3>Why export Google Chrome passwords?</h3>

<p>Exporting your passwords from Chrome is just another step on your way to claiming your freedom from Google. Though its search is very efficient,
Google’s real business model is making money off your data by using it to target you with ads. It uses some pretty underhanded tactics to do this,
too, like <a href="https://localhost:8081/blog/google-privacy-washing-android">privacy washing</a>, where the company pretends to care about privacy even
while monitoring your every move online.</p>

<h3>How to export saved passwords from Chrome</h3>

<p>To export your passwords, go into Chrome and click on your <strong>profile picture</strong> in the top right. A menu will pop out. Click on the <strong>key icon</strong> to
access Chrome’s password manager.</p>
<h2>Apple’s DMA compliance plan is a trap and a slap in the face for the European Commission</h2>

<p><em>Published on 2024-02-05.</em></p>

<p>If there were still doubts over whether Apple is an abusive monopolist, they were emphatically dismissed this week. Apple’s new app store policy that
it claims will bring it into compliance with Europe’s <a href="https://proton.me/blog/dma-deliberations">Digital Markets Act</a> is a textbook case
of malicious compliance (in fact, it’s listed as an example under the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malicious_compliance">malicious compliance</a> Wikipedia entry) that spits in the face of open markets,
fair competition, and the European Commission.</p>

<p>As a recap, Apple currently has a number of policies for its App Store that are so abusive that the European Union was compelled to pass a new law,
the Digital Market Act (DMA), to rein in some of the worst offenses. These abuses include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Requiring developers to pay 30% of their revenue to Apple</li>
<li>Banning alternative payment methods</li>
<li>Not allowing developers to inform users about alternative payment methods</li>
<li>Not allowing developers to inform users that they can obtain a service more cheaply elsewhere</li>
<li>Monopolizing all app distribution via the App Store</li>
</ul>

<h3>Apple threatens major app developers with CTF</h3>

<p>The DMA forces Apple to allow alternative payment methods and pressures it to reduce fees. Apple’s response to complaints about unfair fees is,
yes you guessed it, a new unfair fee.</p>
