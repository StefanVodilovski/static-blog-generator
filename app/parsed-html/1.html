<h1>The Proton Blog</h1><h2>Centralized vs peer-to-peer (P2P) file storage</h2>

<p><em>Published on 2022-11-08.</em></p>

<p>In 2017, hackers stole the private financial records of some 156 million people from servers belonging to Equifax, while the 2018 Facebook-Cambridge
Analytica scandal revealed how personal data belonging to up to 87 million Facebook users was harvested without their consent.</p>

<p>A litany of high-profile data breaches has led to a growth of interest in peer-to-peer (P2P) cloud storage solutions. Instead of storing your
data on centralized servers that can be hacked, these store multiple instances of your data on the drives of a decentralized network of other users.</p>

<p>Several Proton users have asked us whether we considered a decentralized architecture for our end-to-end encrypted cloud storage service,
<a href="https://proton.me/drive">Proton Drive</a>, which will be released later this year.</p>

<p>In this article we will examine the pros and cons of P2P storage, and explain why we have opted for a centralized end-to-end encrypted security
model instead.</p>

<p>For a technical overview of Proton Drive security, please see our <a href="https://proton.me/blog/protondrive-security">Proton Drive security model</a>.</p>
<h2>A privacy analysis of Meta’s new Threads app</h2>

<p><em>Published on 2023-07-13.</em></p>

<p>A new social media app has entered the marketplace for your attention, courtesy of Meta. Threads, an apparent copycat of Twitter, lets you post
500-character, text-based updates and has a similar user interface. The app is part of Instagram, so you can log in with your Instagram account and
immediately start following your familiar contacts. As of July 10, five days after its launch,
<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/07/10/instagrams-threads-app-reaches-100-million-users-in-just-five-days">100 million people have joined</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Right away, two things stood out about Threads with regard to privacy:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>It collects an enormous amount of personal data about you across multiple categories.</li>
<li>Threads is not available in the European Union, where Meta is already in trouble with privacy regulators.</li>
</ul>

<p>These are still the early days of Threads, so it’s difficult to draw too many conclusions about the privacy implications of the new app.
But it’s clear that Meta is not pointing its products in the direction of greater privacy, despite billions in privacy-related fines and internal
warnings that the company doesn’t know how it uses people’s data. In fact, Threads suggests Meta is doing just the opposite.</p>

<p>This article is an overview of what we know so far about how Threads treats privacy, based on the company’s privacy policy, its disclosures on iOS,
and other information that has come to light since the app launch.</p>

<h3>What Threads knows about you</h3>

<p>Thanks to the privacy requirements of Apple’s App Store, we know specifics about what data Threads itself collects. Threads’ own
<a href="https://help.instagram.com/515230437301944">privacy policy</a> is a supplement to <a href="https://privacycenter.instagram.com/policy">Instagram’s policy</a>,
so all of the other Instagram and Meta rules apply.</p>

<p>But Threads adds some additional data collection to enable its planned interoperability with third-party services. It also collects some surprising
data for reasons that aren’t entirely clear. For example, Threads somehow gathers information about people’s credit for “app functionality”.
(It’s not clear how Meta determines creditworthiness, but The Intercept has
<a href="https://theintercept.com/2019/05/20/facebook-data-phone-carriers-ads-credit-score">suggested</a>
the company may use a kind of “correlation profiling”.) And it collects “sensitive info,” such as your ethnicity, sexual orientation, political
opinions, and biometric data, for “product personalization” reasons.</p>
<h2>Email is more than communication – It’s your identity and worth protecting</h2>

<p><em>Published on 2023-10-27.</em></p>

<p>With over <a href="https://www.radicati.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Email-Statistics-Report-2022-2026-Executive-Summary.pdf">4 billion active users</a>
and around 350 million messages sent daily, email is the most successful communications tool ever invented. Yet, it has probably been 15 or 20 years
since email has primarily been about communications.</p>

<p><strong>Today, email is identity</strong>. Your email address is the one common thread that ties together all the various services you use online and serves as
your username or unique identifier stating who you are across the entire internet. You hand it over each time you sign up for a new service online
and offline. From this perspective, your email is like your passport in the physical world, but in actuality, far more important than a passport.
Losing your passport can be a significant inconvenience, but losing your email account can lead to irrecoverable losses.</p>

<p>Given this importance, whoever controls your digital identity controls your present and future — this is where the main battle for the future of the
internet is actually being fought today. Many assumed that when we launched Proton Mail in 2014, our goal was to provide a means for secure
communication, but <strong>the real battle we have been fighting has always been over digital identity</strong>. In that fight, email is far more important than
most people realize.</p>
