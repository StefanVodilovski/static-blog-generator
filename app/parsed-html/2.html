<h1>The Proton Blog</h1><h2>Email is more than communication – It’s your identity and worth protecting</h2>

<p><em>Published on 2023-10-27.</em></p>

<p>With over <a href="https://www.radicati.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Email-Statistics-Report-2022-2026-Executive-Summary.pdf">4 billion active users</a>
and around 350 million messages sent daily, email is the most successful communications tool ever invented. Yet, it has probably been 15 or 20 years
since email has primarily been about communications.</p>

<p><strong>Today, email is identity</strong>. Your email address is the one common thread that ties together all the various services you use online and serves as
your username or unique identifier stating who you are across the entire internet. You hand it over each time you sign up for a new service online
and offline. From this perspective, your email is like your passport in the physical world, but in actuality, far more important than a passport.
Losing your passport can be a significant inconvenience, but losing your email account can lead to irrecoverable losses.</p>

<p>Given this importance, whoever controls your digital identity controls your present and future — this is where the main battle for the future of the
internet is actually being fought today. Many assumed that when we launched Proton Mail in 2014, our goal was to provide a means for secure
communication, but <strong>the real battle we have been fighting has always been over digital identity</strong>. In that fight, email is far more important than
most people realize.</p>
