<h1>The Proton Blog</h1><h2>Apple’s DMA compliance plan is a trap and a slap in the face for the European Commission</h2>

<p><em>Published on 2024-02-05.</em></p>

<p>If there were still doubts over whether Apple is an abusive monopolist, they were emphatically dismissed this week. Apple’s new app store policy that
it claims will bring it into compliance with Europe’s <a href="https://proton.me/blog/dma-deliberations">Digital Markets Act</a> is a textbook case
of malicious compliance (in fact, it’s listed as an example under the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malicious_compliance">malicious compliance</a> Wikipedia entry) that spits in the face of open markets,
fair competition, and the European Commission.</p>

<p>As a recap, Apple currently has a number of policies for its App Store that are so abusive that the European Union was compelled to pass a new law,
the Digital Market Act (DMA), to rein in some of the worst offenses. These abuses include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Requiring developers to pay 30% of their revenue to Apple</li>
<li>Banning alternative payment methods</li>
<li>Not allowing developers to inform users about alternative payment methods</li>
<li>Not allowing developers to inform users that they can obtain a service more cheaply elsewhere</li>
<li>Monopolizing all app distribution via the App Store</li>
</ul>

<h3>Apple threatens major app developers with CTF</h3>

<p>The DMA forces Apple to allow alternative payment methods and pressures it to reduce fees. Apple’s response to complaints about unfair fees is,
yes you guessed it, a new unfair fee.</p>
